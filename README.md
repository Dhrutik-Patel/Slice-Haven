## Tech Features

- The application interacts with a backend service to fetch and post data, maintaining a remote state.
- Utilizes React Router's data loading feature ("render as you fetch") and router actions to communicate with the remote API.
- Global UI state management is handled by Redux Toolkit, with the global state divided into slices for better organization.
- Styling is achieved using Tailwind CSS, ensuring a responsive design that caters to mobile devices first.
